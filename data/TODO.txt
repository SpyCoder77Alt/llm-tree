# Missing models
- Vision Transformer (ViT, ViT-G, ViT-e)
- CLIP?
- ALIGN?
- mT5?
- Sparse transformer
- Conformer
- BEST-RQ
- RNN-T

# Considerations for future additons
- For simplicity, perhaps only include models that have some sort of technical paper written on them. It is hard to trace a model's sources without it.
- Dates can get a bit fuzzy, but unless otherwise noted use the initial publication date of the model's paper
